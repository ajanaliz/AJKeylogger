    This file is used to send mail from out code to remote server.
    To send a mail we have to implement mail protocol - SMTP
        SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    It is used to send mails between mail servers (or computers). Default
    port number is 25. Sooo, that's a very complicated and very long process
    and, we cannot use secure layer (SSL or TLS) to send mail to secure
    mail servers (for example, gmail.com). To do that, we need to implement our
    own SSL/TLS library... or use external. The same thing is for sending mail
    implement non-secure SMTP or use external library.

    Neither. We'll use external program to send mails, program that is 100%
    installed on operating system. That is, Windows PowersSell (PS). Below is a PS
    script that will be printed to our directory and called to send a mail.
    Of course, you can use external library to send mails, or to implement your own...

    Script and functions to call it are defined bellow.
    But exactly the same code (commented) is in this comment. This is a powershell script.
